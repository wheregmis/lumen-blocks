# Switch

Switches are toggles that allow users to turn an option on or off. They're commonly used for binary settings where users can toggle between two states.

## Basic Switch

A basic switch provides a simple way to toggle between states.

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    switch_examples::basic::BasicSwitchExample {}
}
```

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/switch_examples.rs:basic}}
```

## Switch Sizes

Switches come in three sizes to fit different UI contexts.

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    switch_examples::sizes::SwitchSizesExample {}
}
```

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/switch_examples.rs:sizes}}
```

- **Small**: Compact size for dense UIs or when space is limited
- **Medium**: Default size suitable for most interfaces
- **Large**: More prominent size, useful for important settings or improved accessibility

## Switch States

Switches can be enabled or disabled to indicate whether they can be interacted with.

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    switch_examples::states::SwitchStatesExample {}
}
```

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/switch_examples.rs:states}}
```

- **Enabled**: Default state where the switch can be toggled by the user
- **Disabled**: Indicates that the option exists but cannot be changed in the current context

## Switch with Text

Switches can be paired with descriptive text to provide more context about the setting being toggled.

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    switch_examples::with_text::SwitchWithTextExample {}
}
```

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/switch_examples.rs:with_text}}
```

When using switches with additional text:
- Include a clear label that describes what the switch controls
- Consider adding supporting text that explains the current state (on/off) and its implications
- Ensure the switch and its label are properly aligned for visual clarity
