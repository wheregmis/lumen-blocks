# Introduction

Welcome to Laminar Blocks - a styled, opinionated component library for Dioxus based on the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) project, and built on top of the [Dioxus Primitives](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/components) unstyled components library.

## What is Laminar Blocks?

Laminar Blocks provides a collection of pre-styled UI components for Rust's Dioxus framework. These components follow modern design principles and accessibility guidelines, making it easy to build beautiful, functional user interfaces in your Dioxus applications.

## Features

- **Styled**: Pre-designed components with a consistent look and feel
- **Customizable**: Adapt the color theme or the components' designs to match your brand
- **Type-safe**: Leverage Rust's type system for component props
- **Accessible**: We strive to build the components using ARIA attributes and good accessibility principles
- **Based on shadcn/ui**: Inspired by the popular React component collection
